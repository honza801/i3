== NAME

i3-sensible-terminal - launches $TERMINAL with fallbacks

== SYNOPSIS

i3-sensible-terminal [arguments]

== DESCRIPTION

i3-sensible-terminal is invoked in the i3 default config to start a terminal.
This wrapper script is necessary since there is no distribution-independent
terminal launcher (but for example Debian has x-terminal-emulator).
Distribution packagers are responsible for shipping this script in a way which
is appropriate for the distribution.

It tries to start one of the following (in that order):

* $TERMINAL (this is a non-standard variable)
* xterm
* urxvt
* rxvt
* roxterm

Please donâ€™t complain about the order: If the user has any preference, he will
have $TERMINAL set or modified his i3 configuration file.
