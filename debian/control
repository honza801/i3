Description: improved dynamic tiling window manager
 Key features of i3 are good documentation, reasonable defaults (changeable in
 a simple configuration file) and good multi-monitor support. The user
 interface is designed for power users and emphasizes keyboard usage. i3 uses
 XCB for asynchronous communication with X11 and aims to be fast and
 light-weight.
