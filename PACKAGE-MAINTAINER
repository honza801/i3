Dear package maintainer,

thanks for packaging i3. By doing so, you are improving your distribution
and i3 in general.

Please read the file DEPENDS now, so you know which libraries are necessary
and where to get them from if your distribution does not already have
packages for them.

Please make sure the manpage for i3 will be properly created and installed
in your package.

Also please provide the path to a suitable terminal emulator which is installed
as a dependency of your package (e.g. urxvt). On systems which have a special
commend to launch the best available terminal emulator, please use this one
(e.g. x-terminal-emulator on debian).

On debian, this looks like this:

	# Compilation
	$(MAKE) TERM_EMU=x-terminal-emulator
	$(MAKE) -C man

	# Installation
	$(MAKE) DESTDIR=$(CURDIR)/debian/i3-wm/ install
	mkdir -p $(CURDIR)/debian/i3-wm/usr/share/man/man1
	cp man/*.1 $(CURDIR)/debian/i3-wm/usr/share/man/man1

Please make sure that i3-migrate-config-to-v4 and i3-config-wizard are
installed with i3. The Perl script is necessary to (automatically) convert v3
configs to v4. The wizard provides the possibility to create a keysym-based
config with the userâ€™s preferred modifier and should be started on the first
start of i3 (it will automatically exit if it finds a config file).

If you have any questions, ideas, hints, problems or whatever, please do not
hesitate to contact me. I will help you out. Just drop me an E-Mail (find the
address at http://michael.stapelberg.de/Kontakt, scroll down to bottom),
contact me using the same address in jabber or ask on our IRC channel:
(#i3 on irc.twice-irc.de).

Thanks again for your efforts,
Michael
