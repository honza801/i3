# by moving the window in the opposite orientation that its parent has, we
# force i3 to create a new split container with the appropriate orientation.
# However, when doing that two times in a row, we end up with two split
# containers which are then redundant (workspace is horizontal, then v-split,
# then h-split â€“ we could just append the children of the latest h-split to the
# workspace itself).
#
# This testcase checks that the tree is properly flattened after moving.
